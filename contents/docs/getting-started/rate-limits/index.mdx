## Rate Limits
Rate limits ensure fair usage and server stability.

### Default Rate Limits
100 requests per minute (default), but you can increase the limit to 300 requests per minute.

### How to Monitor Usage
1. Access the `URLS` in your dashboard.
2. View your request analytics and rate limit status.

### Example Error for Exceeding Limits
When the rate limit is exceeded, the API responds with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. This indicates that you have surpassed the allowed number of requests within the set timeframe.

### Common Issues
1. **Invalid Token:** Ensure the `rwps_token` is valid and included in the headers.
2. **Rate Limit Exceeded:** Check your API usage and wait before retrying.
3. **Invalid URLs:** Confirm that URLs are properly formatted.

### Tips for Developers
- **Optimize Requests:** Bundle multiple operations into fewer API calls.
- **Use Descriptive Links:** Make URLs easier to identify and manage.
- **Monitor Metrics:** Regularly review analytics to optimize campaigns.
