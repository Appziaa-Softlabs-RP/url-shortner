## Authentication
Authentication is required for all API interactions. Each user is assigned a unique API token (`rwps_token`) for secure access.

### How to Obtain Your API Token
1. Log in to your RWPS account.
2. Navigate to `Settings -> API Section`.
3. Register your application to generate a token.

### Example Request Header
Include the token in the request headers:
```http
Headers:
    rwps_token: your_generated_api_token
```

### Best Practices
- Keep your token secure and do not share it.
